## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Using APIs in a React project:
    - feeding the state with data from the API response
    - use of useEffect hook to initialize the page render with a first API call

- Implementing a map in a project, using LeafletJS and React Leaflet.
